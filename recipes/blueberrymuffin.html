        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><b>These blueberry muffins are extra large and yummy with a sugary-cinnamon crumb topping. I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top for a wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin. Add extra blueberries if you want!</b></p>

            <li>¼ cup butter, cubed</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

            <li>For the muffins: Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark; stir until combined. Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries; set batter aside.</li>

        </ol>
